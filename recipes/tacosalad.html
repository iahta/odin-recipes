    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>This taco salad is a tasty twist on the conventional taco salad. 
        And the children have fun helping me prepare all the extras before we mix it 
        all together! You can also place the spicy beef and toppings in individual 
        serving bowls and allow people to assemble their own salads.</p>
    
    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Beef:</strong>This meaty taco salad starts with a 
            pound of lean ground beef. </li>
        <li><strong>Beans:</strong>You'll also need a can of chili beans. </li>
        <li><strong>Dressing:</strong>Use store-bought or 
            homemade French salad dressing. You can easily omit this ingredient if you 
            prefer a more traditional flavor. </li>
        <li><strong>Seasoning:</strong>Use store-bought or homemade taco seasoning mix. </li>
        <li><strong>Chips:</strong>Crushed tortilla chips add welcome crunch and salty flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Lettuce:</strong>You can't have taco salad without shredded iceberg lettuce!</li>
        <li><strong>Toppings:</strong>Top your taco salad with Cheddar cheese, tomatoes, 
            salsa (store-bought or homemade, of course), and sour cream. </li>
    
    </ul>    
    <h3>Optional</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>More popular toppings include jalapenos, corn, pico de gallo, avocado, 
            black beans, onions, and black olives. </li>
        <li>If you like, you can serve the taco salad in a store-bought tortilla bowl 
            or in our homemade baked tortilla bowls. </li>

    </ul>
