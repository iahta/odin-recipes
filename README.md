#odin-recipes
First project in the Odin Project

Setting up a website to display a list of recipes, with links to those recipes. 

By the end, I should have used everything I have learned so far to build this website, like I'm doing right now with setting up a repository to work on the code, or commiting to memory the boilerplate set up for html and the basic elements that allow for links, images, customized texts.
